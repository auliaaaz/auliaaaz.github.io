## Google Play Store Recommendation Apps
The Google Play Store dataset used here consists of two main files:
1. googleplaystore.csv: This dataset contains a list of Android apps along with details such as genre, user ratings, and more.
2. googleplaystore_users_reviews.csv: This dataset includes user reviews (and some sentiment scores) which are associated with the apps listed in the first dataset.
Our goal with this data is to perform various analysis techniques to ultimately recommend the top 5 apps for download.
