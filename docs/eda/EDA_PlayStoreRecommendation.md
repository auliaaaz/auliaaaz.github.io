## Google Play Store Recommendation Apps
The Google Play Store dataset used here consists of two main files:
1. googleplaystore.csv: This dataset contains a list of Android apps along with details such as genre, user ratings, and more.
2. googleplaystore_users_reviews.csv: This dataset includes user reviews (and some sentiment scores) which are associated with the apps listed in the first dataset.
Our goal with this data is to perform various analysis techniques to ultimately recommend the top 5 apps for download.

## Data Cleaning

In this section, we clean the Google Play Store dataset to prepare it for analysis.

```python
# Remove additional spaces
clean_google_play_store = google_play_store.applymap(
    lambda x: x.strip() if isinstance(x, str) else x)

# Sort row based on the Last Updated to remove duplicated later based on that
clean_google_play_store = clean_google_play_store.sort_values(by='Last Updated')

# Drop duplicates for the App column
# This step ensures that only one entry per app is kept, discarding older versions
clean_google_play_store = google_play_store.drop_duplicates(keep="last")
clean_google_play_store = clean_google_play_store.reset_index(drop=True)

# Drop duplicates especially for App column, to only keep the unique updated App data
clean_google_play_store = google_play_store.drop_duplicates(subset='App', keep="last")
clean_google_play_store = clean_google_play_store.reset_index(drop=True)

clean_google_play_store.info()
```

```python
# Remove additional character in object types that supposed to be integer type
# Converting kb size into mb
def convert_kb_to_mb(size):
  if 'k' in size:
    kb_size = float(size.replace('k', ''))
    mb_size = kb_size / 1024
  if 'M' in size:
    mb_size = float(size.replace('M', ''))
  else:
    mb_size = 'nan'
  return mb_size

# Applying the convert kb to mb function to Size column
clean_google_play_store['Size'] = clean_google_play_store['Size'].apply(convert_kb_to_mb)

# Removing additional character with replacing it with empty string in Installs column
clean_google_play_store['Installs'] = clean_google_play_store['Installs'].replace(r'[+, ,]', '', regex=True)
clean_google_play_store['Installs'] = clean_google_play_store['Installs'].astype(int)

# Removing additional character with replacing it with empty string in Price column
clean_google_play_store['Price'] = clean_google_play_store['Price'].replace(r'[$]', '', regex=True)
clean_google_play_store['Price'] = clean_google_play_store['Price'].astype(float)
```

## Data Exploration and Visualization

We start by grouping the data by category to analyze the number of installations per category.
This helps us understand which categories have the most installed apps.

Then, we create a bar chart to visually represent the total number of installs by category.

```python
# Group by category according to number of instalation
installs_avg_category = clean_google_play_store.groupby('Category')['Installs'].sum().reset_index()
installs_avg_category = installs_avg_category.sort_values(by='Installs', ascending=False)

# Create a bar chart to visualize the total installs by category
num_category = px.bar(installs_avg_category, x='Category',  y='Installs', title='Total Installs by Category')
num_category.show()
```
<div style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;">
    <iframe src="https://auliaaaz.github.io/docs/eda/images/PlayStoreRecommendation/Total%20Installs%20by%20Category.html" 
        width="700" 
        height="600px" 
        style="border: none; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
</div>

The chart shows that the categories of 'Communication,' 'Games,' 'Family,' and 'Tools' boast the highest installation rates among users. Since our goal is to recommend applications that offer unique experiences and aren't overly mainstream, we'll factor in the number of installations to filter our list of applications. This will serve as our starting point to select a niche or explore new possibilities for users to explore and install.

Next, we will also visualize the rating of each category because we wanted those list application are applications that user most like with reputable rating.

```python
# Group by category according to ratings
ratings_avg_category = clean_google_play_store.groupby('Category')['Rating'].mean().reset_index()
ratings_avg_category = ratings_avg_category.sort_values(by='Rating', ascending=False)

# Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of ratings for each category
rating_category = px.box(clean_google_play_store, x='Category',  y='Rating', title='Ratings Distribution by Category')
rating_category.show()
```
<div style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;">
    <iframe src="https://auliaaaz.github.io/docs/eda/images/PlayStoreRecommendation/Ratings%20Distribution%20by%20Category.html" 
        width="700" 
        height="600px" 
        style="border: none; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
</div>
